### a) Raspberry Pi GPIO, 15'
* Use the [Grove hat](https://github.com/tamberg/fhnw-iot/wiki/Grove-Adapters#grove-base-hat-for-raspberry-pi) to connect Grove sensors to the Pi.
* Install the grove.py library and use it with Node-RED.
* Check the [Grove hat pinout](https://github.com/tamberg/fhnw-iot/wiki/Grove-Adapters#pinout-1), use 3.3V modules only.
* No hat? Use [wires](https://github.com/tamberg/fhnw-iot/wiki/Grove-Adapters#grove-jumper-wires), check the [Raspberry Pi pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/wiringpi).

### b) Edge gateways, 10'
* Chose one of the edge gateway projects and analyse it.
* Which protocol is used to transmit data to the cloud?
* How are updates deployed to the gateway, by whom?
* How can a proprietary local protocol be integrated?
* Be prepared to present your results.

### c) Embedded ML use cases, 10'
* Assuming devices can know your face, voice, mood.
* Which new use cases become possible with edge ML?
* Try to take a "[thing centered](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/thing-centered-design/)" perspective, as a device.
* Be prepared to present your results.
